## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior
and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior
that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

To report conduct concerns, open an issue with the `[conduct]` label or use
[GitHub's private reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam).

There is no guaranteed response time or SLA for conduct reports.
