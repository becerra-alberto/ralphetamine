During implementation I discovered some useful patterns.

<ralph>LEARN: vitest describe blocks should use consistent naming conventions</ralph>

Also found that the database layer has a specific pattern.

<ralph>LEARN: SQLite migration columns need explicit type declarations</ralph>

All done with the implementation.

<ralph>DONE 2.1</ralph>
