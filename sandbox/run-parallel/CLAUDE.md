# Bookmarks Project

A bash script that manages a bookmarks JSON file. Supports adding, listing, searching, and displaying bookmark details.

## Conventions
- All scripts go in `src/`
- All tests go in `tests/`
- Data stored in `data/bookmarks.json`
- Use jq for JSON manipulation
- Scripts must be executable (`chmod +x`)
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang
- Follow Bash 3.2 compatibility
