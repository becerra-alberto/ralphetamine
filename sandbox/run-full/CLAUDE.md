# Calculator Project

A bash calculator with input parsing and output formatting. Supports basic arithmetic, parentheses, and formatted output.

## Conventions
- All scripts go in `src/`
- All tests go in `tests/`
- Scripts must be executable (`chmod +x`)
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang
- Follow Bash 3.2 compatibility
- Use bc for floating-point arithmetic
