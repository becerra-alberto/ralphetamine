A simple command-line tool called "md2html" that converts Markdown files to HTML.

It should:
- Accept a markdown file path as input
- Output HTML to stdout by default
- Support an -o/--output flag to write to a file
- Handle basic markdown: headings, bold, italic, links, code blocks, lists
- Support a --watch flag that re-converts when the source file changes
- Exit with code 1 and a helpful error if the input file doesn't exist
- Include a --help flag showing usage

The tool should be written in pure bash using sed for transformations.
No external dependencies beyond standard Unix tools.
