# Support

Ralphetamine is provided as-is. There is **no support SLA** or guaranteed response time.

You may open GitHub issues for bugs or feature requests, but issues may be closed
without response if they are out of scope or not aligned with the roadmap.

If you need dedicated support, you should fork the project and maintain it internally.
