# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please open a GitHub issue describing the impact,
steps to reproduce, and any suggested mitigations.

There is **no guaranteed response time** or SLA for security reports. For issues
you believe are critical, include \"[SECURITY]\" in the issue title.
