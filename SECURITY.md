# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please use
[GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
to report it confidentially. Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

There is **no guaranteed response time** or SLA for security reports.
